## Execution Guidelines
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Only install extensions specified by the get_project_setup_info tool.
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project
